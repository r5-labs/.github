# R5 Network

R5 revisits the proof‑of‑work consensus mechanism to create a high‑performance, secure blockchain. It is capable of processing over 1,000 transactions per second while leveraging battle‑tested architecture and privacy features.

R5 Labs is the organization responsible for ensuring that the R5 network ecosystem has all the tools and infrastructure it needs to thrive. It does that by deploying and maintaining infrastructure, as well as by developing tools and applications that allow users to connect and interact with the blockchain.
